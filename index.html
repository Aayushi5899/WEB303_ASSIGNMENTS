        <td>Ross</td>
        <td>
          Ross is a character that most people generally tend to like for his
          affectionate nature, but most people never really rate him at the very
          top of the likability scale and would rather not relate with this
          character all that often.

        <td>Monica Geller</td>
        <td>
          Ross' sister is easily one of the cleanest and most meticulous
          characters in the entire group, never failing to ensure that little to
          no problems come up when it comes to the day-to-day living in her
          house.

        <td>Chandler Bing</td>
        <td>
          Chandler is one of the most beloved characters on the show, in no
          small part due to the fact that he constantly manages to keep the
          jokes moving at a fast face with his relentless one-liners and dry
          sarcasm.

        <td>
          If there's one thing that people can say about Rachel, it's that she
          definitely does everything possible when it comes to achieving
          something she really wants.

          The lovable charmer of the group is also one of the most stupid
          characters on the show, but people don't care — after all, it's the
          stupidity of Joey Tribbiani that truly puts him a cut above the rest.

          Phoebe is the lovable weirdo of the group — or "wonderfully weird" as
          per her husband — and never fails to entertain viewers with her zany
          and unique antics that have become a mainstay of her character.
